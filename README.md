# Orchestration Agent

An orchestration-first open-source coding agent runtime.

The strongest model plans and delegates work; cheaper or specialized workers execute isolated tasks. Users define routing, concurrency, review, retry, and escalation behavior in natural language. That policy is compiled to a typed Policy IR and enforced by a deterministic scheduler.

## Project plan

The current v0.1 development plan is available in:

- [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md) — source-of-truth development plan
- [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.docx`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.docx) — formatted document version


## Architecture

```text
Natural-language policy
        ↓
Policy compiler → Policy IR
        ↓
Planner → proposed task DAG
        ↓
Policy validator/router
        ↓
Deterministic scheduler
        ↓
Isolated workers (Git worktrees / sandbox)
        ↓
Validation / review / merge
```

## Stack

- Node.js 24 LTS
- TypeScript, strict mode, ESM
- npm workspaces
- Zod for runtime schemas
- SQLite + Drizzle planned for durable sessions
- Ink/React planned for the TUI
- Git worktrees for parallel worker isolation
- JSONL events / JSON-RPC for integrations

## Packages

- `@agent/ai` — model/provider abstraction
- `@agent/core` — shared agent and tool primitives
- `@agent/policy` — natural-language policy IR and validation
- `@agent/orchestration` — task DAG, router and deterministic scheduler
- `@agent/workspace` — local/worktree execution isolation
- `@agent/protocol` — typed runtime events
- `@agent/session` — session persistence contracts
- `@agent/plugin` — extension API contracts
- `@agent/coding-agent` — top-level runtime facade
- `@agent/tui` — terminal UI shell
- `apps/cli` — executable CLI

## First milestone

The first usable milestone should support:

1. one provider and a single-agent tool loop;
2. typed task planning;
3. natural-language policy compilation;
4. DAG scheduling and model routing;
5. isolated Git-worktree workers;
6. review/retry/escalation;
7. JSONL events and a basic terminal UI.
